                the protagonist gets at the beginning of the game. They are <span class="dark-red">semi-fast</span>
                weapons. Pistols deal very low damage to <span class="dark-red">armored</span>
                units, unless a specific pistol has been picked a.k.a. <span class="dark-red">Desert Eagle</span>.   
                Their upperhand is their usage as they are only one-hand sidearm. This allows the user to use them on a <span class="dark-red">zipline</span>.
                Still, they are a great choice for the beginners and the ones who can aim good for the <span class="dark-red">head</span>.

                    <p>Submachine-guns are generally harder to find on the field of battle. Not a lot of enemy
                    use this kind of a weapon. They are rather short on the <span class="dark-red">clips</span>.
                    Another problem is their accuracy and a bit worse damage than pistols. Still they are very effective against <span class="dark-red">low armored</span> targets.
                    Currently the <span class="dark-red">mp5</span> holds its place as the best smg there is to offer. <span class="dark-red">Scorpion</span> offers higher rate of fire in exchange of accuracy.
                    The choice is yours...

                    <p>Assault rifles are the most popular choice of a weapon among everyone.
                    Not a surprise there as they deal medium-to-high damage and can penetrate most armors. The famous <span class="dark-red">AK-47</span>
                    can be found anywhere you look. The downside is that  
                    <span class="dark-red">AK-47</span> doesn't offer any upgrades for itself. Therefore, other weapons may be slightly better
                    as they allow multiple upgrades and have more stability and less recoil than the mentioned <span class="dark-red">AK-47</span>.

                    <span class="dark-red">Shotguns</span> are also very effective against any kind of an animal.

                     Some sniper rifles are automatic which allows the user to shot multiple shots in a short amount of time. <span class="dark-red">SVD</span>

                        Most heavy-armored enemy's will use these weapons. They are highly-deadly but makes the user move slower because of their weight.
                        Some other heavy weapons like <span class="dark-red">RPG</span> are used against choppers and vehicles. Extremely deadly at any range.
